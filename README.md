# Operating System (OS) Scheduling Algorithms

> This project contains various scheduling algorithms in the Operating Systems.

The files are divided into three categories.
1. Scheduling Algorithms:
   This contains files like fcfs.py i.e. files that implement a particular algorithm.
   Takes list of process as input and calculates completion, turn_around and waiting time.

2. process.py:
   This file contains implementation of a single process.
3. main.py:
   Takes user input and demonstrates how an algorithm can be implemented.
